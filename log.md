**Today's Progress:** Reviewed Big O notation and played with the idea of creating topic infographics to help cement learning concepts.

**Thoughts:** The mathematical concepts behind Big O are a little too heavy for me at this stage and I could get really hung up on them. I think a better approach is to utilize a Big O for dummies approach as I believe there is a website out there for that. Additionally, I need to be able to look at like 90% of algorithms and systematically find their correct time complexity. Goals!

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed Big O notation MORE, created an Infographic on constant, linear, and quadratic Big O examples, solved FizzBuzz in Java for the first time, started Interviews.school for interview prep guidance, and created an 8 point Leetcode/Algorithmic Problem step-by-step guide

**Thoughts:** Writing it all down on paper shows me that I really studied alot today but I need to step it up and do more if I'm going to maintain my goal timeline. Additionally, I really like the idea of creating and sharing further infographics on varying concepts bc teaching is the best way to learn. Lastly, I'm looking at creating a plan to hit at least 3 main goals per day - multiple Leetcode problems and algorithm studies, a system design problem or at least time spent thinking about it, and at least 1 informational video/article on any software engineer-esque topic.

**Today's Progress:** Feeling better - redid resume to match a more professional template, began Mosh's DS & Algo video and built an Array class from scratch, solved 2 Algo problems on Codesignal, solved 1.leetcode with two solutions 

**Thoughts:** I have a lot to do. It's like sitting at the foot of a mountain and staring up at its peak. But, I know I can do it. The only limiting factor I have is time.
