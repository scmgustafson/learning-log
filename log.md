## Day 2: 22/09/2023

**Today's Progress:**
- Completed Python Crash Course chapter 2

**Thoughts:**
- I spent less than an hour today and was able to very quickly work through chapter 2. While it was pretty elementary and I feel like I should have all of this memorized at my current level of experienced, it was really helpful to go through the very basics again. There were some helpful reminders about how Python works under the hood, like that variables are labels not boxes or some string methods like upper() or lower() don't actually change the value of the string.
