**Thoughts:**
- I'm back

## Day 2: 22/09/2023

**Today's Progress:**
- Completed Python Crash Course chapter 2

**Thoughts:**
- I spent less than an hour today and was able to very quickly work through chapter 2. While it was pretty elementary and I feel like I should have all of this memorized at my current level of experienced, it was really helpful to go through the very basics again. There were some helpful reminders about how Python works under the hood, like that variables are labels not boxes or some string methods like upper() or lower() don't actually change the value of the string.

## Day 3: 23/09/2023

**Today's Progress:**
- 8 mile walk with Rickelle
- Started the Game Chronicles repo for journalling on gaming sessions
- Finished chapter 3 of PCC

**Thoughts:**
- It's been a very busy but satisfying day. It was important for Rickelle and I to move around in addition to me fitting in about an hour of study time for some practice with lists. Again, some of the material felt very elementary but it was also very good practice. Most of my previous DS and Algo work was done with Java so its nice to get some practice in with Python. Additionally, I started my 'game-chronicles' journal which I think should be a pretty fun little side project as a way to improve/enhance my gaming time.

## Day 4: 24/09/2023

**Today's Progress:**
- Completed PCC chapter 4

**Thoughts:**
- One of the things I learned about today is creating a new list by taking a whole slice of the original list. This is done because regular assignment of list2 = list1 just references the original list. Great example of how variables are labels and not boxes. Almost like CNAME records?

## Day 5: 25/09/2023

**Today's Progress:**
- Back in the gym this morning
- Read through PCC chapter 5 and completed only the valuable exercises
- Read through PCC chapter 6 and completed only the valuable exercises

**Thoughts:**
- To move faster on Python review, need to priotize completing only the valuable exercises. The most elementary ones should be skipped from now on.

## Day 6: 26/09/2023

**Today's Progress:**
- Worked through PCC chapter 7

**Thoughts:**
- Busy, busy. At this time, I am trying to do at least 1 chapter a day. Hopefully will be started on the 3 starter projects by this weekend. Would be really cool to knock at least one of those out. My rough plan is to work through those 3 projects and then decide on next course of action. Could be another Python project (need to practice with some sort of API framework), moving to DS&A study to brush up on those concepts, or moving onto Certified Kubernetes Admin courses.

## Day 7: 27/09/2023

**Today's Progress:**
- Completed chapter 8 of PCC

**Thoughts:**
- While considering my thoughts from yesterday, I realize that I can do a 'side side' project during the PCC projects. I could probably implement some form of CICD (linting?) for the project repos

## Day 8: 28/09/2023

**Today's Progress:**
- Started PCC chapter 9 and worked through a portion of the exercises

**Thoughts:**
- Was in a rush this morning due to having to go to the office. Its been pretty difficult to keep this schedule with the other lifestyle changes I have been making but its been very rewarding. I'm already finding I am able to read code better at work (though my skill level is still simple).

- NA

## Day 9: 29/09/2023

**Today's Progress:**
- Continued working through PCC chapter 9 and finished it

**Thoughts:**
- Had a good time messing around with some 'lottery analysis' which was enjoyable. Ready to get a move on with these extra projects though it is going to be a busy weekend.
