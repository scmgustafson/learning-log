## Day 2: 22/09/2023

**Today's Progress:**
- Completed Python Crash Course chapter 2

**Thoughts:**
- I spent less than an hour today and was able to very quickly work through chapter 2. While it was pretty elementary and I feel like I should be able to have all of this memorized at my current level of experienced, it was really helpful to go through the very basics again.
