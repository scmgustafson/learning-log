**Today's Progress:** Reviewed Big O notation and played with the idea of creating topic infographics to help cement learning concepts.

**Thoughts:** The mathematical concepts behind Big O are a little too heavy for me at this stage and I could get really hung up on them. I think a better approach is to utilize a Big O for dummies approach as I believe there is a website out there for that. Additionally, I need to be able to look at like 90% of algorithms and systematically find their correct time complexity. Goals!
