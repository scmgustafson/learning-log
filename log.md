## Day 2: 22/09/2023

**Today's Progress:**
- Completed Python Crash Course chapter 2

**Thoughts:**
- I spent less than an hour today and was able to very quickly work through chapter 2. While it was pretty elementary and I feel like I should have all of this memorized at my current level of experienced, it was really helpful to go through the very basics again. There were some helpful reminders about how Python works under the hood, like that variables are labels not boxes or some string methods like upper() or lower() don't actually change the value of the string.

## Day 3: 23/09/2023

**Today's Progress:**
- 8 mile walk with Rickelle
- Started the Game Chronicles repo for journalling on gaming sessions
- Finished chapter 3 of PCC

**Thoughts:**
- It's been a very busy but satisfying day. It was important for Rickelle and I to move around in addition to me fitting in about an hour of study time for some practice with lists. Again, some of the material felt very elementary but it was also very good practice. Most of my previous DS and Algo work was done with Java so its nice to get some practice in with Python. Additionally, I started my 'game-chronicles' journal which I think should be a pretty fun little side project as a way to improve/enhance my gaming time.

## Day 4: 24/09/2023

**Today's Progress:**
- Completed PCC chapter 4

**Thoughts:**
- One of the things I learned about today is creating a new list by taking a whole slice of the original list. This is done because regular assignment of list2 = list1 just references the original list. Great example of how variables are labels and not boxes. Almost like CNAME records?
